# Chatbox with GPT OpenAI Integration

This repository contains a chatbox application built using HTML, CSS ,JavaScript and integrating OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model for interactive and dynamic conversations.
I have added the weather function, get student count and get college info function calls.

## Features

- **User-Defined Function Calls**: Allows users to enter specific queries like weather or total number of students in college that GPT cannot answer directly. Custom functions handle these queries.
- **GPT Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT functionality to generate human-like responses based on user input.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Provides a user-friendly chat interface for seamless communication with the chatbox.
- **Real-time Responses**: Delivers real-time responses from the GPT model and user-defined functions, enhancing the user experience.



## Usage

To use the projection chatbox, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Start a conversation with the chatbox by typing a message in the input field 

4. Enter specific queries like "weather" or "total number of students in college" to trigger user-defined functions for handling these queries.

5. The chatbox will generate a response using the GPT model or a custom function based on the query and display it in the conversation.

## Configuration (IMPORTANT)

To set up the GPT OpenAI integration, you'll need to:

1. Sign up for an OpenAI account and obtain an API key.

2. Add your API key to the JavaScript file where GPT API calls are made.

   ```javascript
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
   ```
3. **USE YOUR USE API KEYS. THE PROJECT WILL NOT WORK OTHERWISE.**
